= GrowlSSHNotifier for Ruby

This library provides the ability to send {growl notifications}[http://growl.info/] to local or remote computers using ssh.

This release provides the following features:

* Simple API.

* Smartly selects ssh method to minimize time.

* Allows the use of custom icons or images.


== Download

The latest version of GrowlSSHNotifier can be found at

* http://github.com/threadhead/growl-ssh-notifier/tree


== Requirements

* net-ssh (version >= 2.0), if sending notifications to remote hosts that do not have rsa/dsa authentication

== Installation

Download the sources directly and copy the growl-ssh-notifier directory into the lib directory (or directory of your choice) of your project. Add the following to your code:

  require 'lib/growl_ssh_notifier'

You can also clone the repository into your lib directory

  git clone git://github.com/threadhead/growl-ssh-notifier.git lib/growl-ssh-notifier

Then add the following to your code:

  require 'lib/growl_ssh_notifier'



=== Testing

You can execute the basic library test with a simple <tt>rake test</tt> from the growl-ssh-notifier directory.

There are options tests that will send growl notifications to either the localhost computer or remote computers.

The installation process creates a configuration file
(<tt>queues.cfg</tt>) located in the same directory as the library.
You can specify a different location for the configuration file using
the option <tt>-c</tt> of <tt>--config</tt>.

When you use the queue manager, it looks for a specified configuration
file, or if no configuration file is specified it looks for the
<tt>queues.cfg</tt> file, first in the local directory and then in the
installation directory. If no file exists, it will create a default one
to use the disk-based message store.



== Simple Example

  require 'growl_ssh_notifier'

  rec = GrowlSSHNotifier::Receiver.new("localhost")
  rec.send_notification('Test Message', 'This is a test message sent to the LOCALHOST machine with GrowlSSHNotifier.')
